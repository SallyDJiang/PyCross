Please make sure the images file is correctly downloaded in order to start the program. This is to ensure that there you will still be able to play the game even if you do not provide the program an image. Thanks! 

To Start: 
1. run Game.py in Terminal and you should be prompted with: 
```
Would you like to create or play a game? (Enter 'c' or 'p')
```

2. If you wish to create your own picross game, please insert a filepath to your image (size max: 100KB). 

3. You will be asked for a window size: 
```
How big would you like the window?
```
for easy: 10, medium: 20, hard: 25, extreme: 30. Please be advised that the bigger your size, the more cluttered your screen will be. 

3. You will be asked if you would like to make a game: 
```
Would you like to make a game with this image? (Y/N)
```
